title: "Row Grouping - Sticky Groups"
enterprise: true

This section covers Sticky Groups, which display group rows that are expanded at the top of the viewport while the last child of the group is also in the viewport.

## Enabling Sticky Groups

To enable sticky groups, set the `groupRowsSticky` property to true. This behaviour applies to all row group levels.

<snippet spaceBetweenProperties="true">
const gridOptions = {
    columnDefs: [
        { field: 'country', rowGroup: true, hide: true },
        { field: 'year', rowGroup: true, hide: true },
        { field: 'athlete' },
        { field: 'sport' },
        { field: 'total' }
    ],
    groupRowsSticky: true
}
</snippet>

In the snippet above, rows will be grouped by `country` and `year` as both column definitions have `rowGroup=true` declared.

The example below demonstrates the default row grouping behaviour with sticky groups. Note the following:

- There are two active row groups as the supplied `country` and `year` column definitions have `rowGroup=true` declared.

- Expand the **UNITED STATES** row group and scroll the grid down. Note the **UNITED STATES** group row will remain at the top of the viewport while you’re scrolling through its children as `groupRowsSticky = true`.

## With Multiple Group Columns

Sticky groups supports row grouping using Multiple Group Columns.

[[note]]
| At the moment `groupRowsSticky` does not work with the following features: [Hide Open Parents](/grouping-multiple-group-columns/#hide-open-parents) and [Row Pagination](/row-pagination/). Turning them on at the same time will cause unexpected behaviour.

<snippet spaceBetweenProperties="true">
const gridOptions = {
    columnDefs: [
        { field: 'country', rowGroup: true, hide: true },
        { field: 'year', rowGroup: true, hide: true },
        { field: 'athlete' },
        { field: 'sport' },
        { field: 'total' }
    ],
    groupDisplayType: 'multipleColumns',
    groupRowsSticky: true
}
</snippet>

In the snippet above, rows will be grouped by `country` and `year` as both column definitions have `rowGroup=true` declared. The snippet also sets `groupDisplayType='multipleColumns'`, displaying a separate column for each group column. Setting  `groupRowsSticky=true` turns on sticky groups which will apply to all the group columns.

This is demonstrated in the following example, note the following:

- There are two active row groups as the supplied `country` and `year` column definitions have `rowGroup=true` declared.

- Separate group columns are displayed for `country` and `year` as `groupDisplayType = 'multipleColumns'`.

- Expand the **UNITED STATES** and **2008** row groups and scroll the grid down. Note the group rows for both **UNITED STATES** and **2008** will remain at the top while you scroll through its children as `groupRowsSticky = true`.

## With Group Rows

Sticky groups supports row grouping using Group Rows.

<snippet spaceBetweenProperties="true">
const gridOptions = {
    columnDefs: [
        { field: 'country', rowGroup: true, hide: true },
        { field: 'year', rowGroup: true, hide: true },
        { field: 'sport' },
        { field: 'total' }
    ],
    groupDisplayType: 'groupRows',
    groupRowsSticky: true
}
</snippet>

In the snippet above, rows will be grouped by `country` and `year` as both column definitions have `rowGroup=true` declared.
These row groups will be displayed using Group Rows as `groupDisplayType = 'groupRows'` and `groupRowsSticky=true` turns on sticky groups.

The example below demonstrates the Group Rows display type. Note the following:

- There are two active row groups as the supplied `country` and `year` column definitions have `rowGroup=true` declared.

- Instead of group columns, the row groups are displayed using full width group rows as `groupDisplayType = 'groupRows'`.

- Expand the **UNITED STATES** row group and scroll the grid down. Note the **UNITED STATES** group row will remain at the top while you’re scrolling through its children as `groupRowsSticky = true`.
