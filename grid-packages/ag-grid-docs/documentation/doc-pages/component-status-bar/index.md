The Status Bar Panel allows you to add your own components to the grid's Status Bar. Use this when the provided status bar components do not meet your requirements.

## Status Panel Parameters

## Configuring Status Bar Panels

In order to add new components to the Status Bar (or to configure the provided `agAggregationComponent` component) you need to provide the components and any associated information to `statusBar`:

md-include:configure-javascript.md
md-include:configure-angular.md
md-include:configure-react.md
md-include:configure-vue.md

Order is important here - the order of the components provided will determine the order in which they're rendered, from left to right.

<grid-example title='Status Bar Panel' name='custom-component' type='generated' options='{ "enterprise": true, "modules": ["clientside", "statusbar", "range"] }'></grid-example>

## Initialisation of Status Bar Components

The status bar components will be instantiated before the grid is fully initialised - specifically they will be initialised
before any row data has been rendered.

If you have a component that you wish to work on data once it's ready (calculate the sum of a column for example) then you'll
need to hook into the `modelUpdated` event. Remember to remove the event listener when the component is destroyed.

## Accessing Status Bar Panel Instances

After the grid has created an instance of a status bar component it is possible to access that instance. This is useful if you want to call a method that you provide on the status bar component that has nothing to do with the operation of the grid. Accessing a status bar component is done using the grid API `getStatusPanel(key)`.

The example below shows using `getStatusPanel`:
