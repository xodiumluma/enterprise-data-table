Master Rows are the rows inside the Master Grid that can be expanded to display Detail Grids.

## Static Master Rows

Once a Master Grid is configured with `masterDetail=true`, all rows in the Master Grid behave as Master Rows, in that they can be expanded to display Detail Grids.

<snippet>
const gridOptions = {
    // by itself, all rows will be expandable
    masterDetail: true,
}
</snippet>

Because Static Master Rows are used in all the basic examples of Master / Detail, another example is not given here.

## Dynamic Master Rows

Dynamic Master Rows allows specifically deciding what rows in the Master Grid can be expanded. This can be useful if, for example, a Master Row has no child records, then it may not be desirable to allow expanding the Master Row.

To specify which rows should expand, provide the grid callback `isRowMaster`. The callback will be called once for each row. Return `true` to allow expanding and `false` to disallow expanding for that row.

<api-documentation source='grid-options/properties.json' section='masterDetail' names='["isRowMaster"]'></api-documentation>

<snippet spaceBetweenProperties="true">
const gridOptions = {
    // turn on master detail
    masterDetail: true,
    // specify which rows to expand
    isRowMaster: dataItem => {
        return expandThisRow ? true : false;
    }
}
</snippet>

The following example only shows detail rows when there are corresponding child records.

<grid-example title='Dynamic Master Rows' name='dynamic' type='generated' options='{ "enterprise": true, "exampleHeight": 510, "modules": ["clientside", "masterdetail", "menu", "columnpanel"] }'></grid-example>

## Changing Dynamic Master Rows

The callback `isRowMaster` is re-called after data changes in the row as a result of a [Transaction Update](/data-update-transactions/). This gives the opportunity to change whether the row is expandable or not.

```js
// to get isRowMaster called again, update the row using a Transaction Update
const transaction = { update: [ updatedRecord1, updatedRecord2 ] };
gridApi.applyTransaction(transaction);
```

In the example below, only Master Rows that have data to show are expandable. Note the following:

- Row 'Nora Thomas' has no detail records, thus is not expandable.
- Row 'Mila Smith' has detail records, thus is expandable.
- Clicking 'Clear Mila Calls' removes detail records from Mila Smith which results in the Mila Smith row no longer being a Master Row.
- Clicking 'Set Mila Calls' sets detail records from Mila Smith which results in the Mila Smith becoming a Master Row.

The example below extends the previous example. It demonstrates a common scenario of the Master Row controlling the Detail Rows. Note the following:

- Each Master Row has buttons to add or remove one detail row.
- Clicking 'Add' will:
    - Add one detail row.
    - Ensure the Master Row is expandable.
    - Ensure the Master Row is expanded (i.e. the Detail Grid is visible).

- Clicking 'Remove' will:
    - Remove one detail row.
    - If no detail rows exist, ensure Master Row is not expandable
