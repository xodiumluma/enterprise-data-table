title: "Select Cell Editor"
---

Simple editor that uses HTML `select`, allowing users to select a cell value from a list of provided values.

## Enabling Select Cell Editor

Edit any cell in the grid below to see the Select Cell Editor.

<grid-example title='Select Editor' name='select-editor' type='generated' options='{ "modules": ["clientside"] }'></grid-example>

Enabled with `agSelectCellEditor` and configured with `ISelectCellEditorParams`.

<snippet transform={false}>
columnDefs: [
    {
        cellEditor: 'agSelectCellEditor',
        cellEditorParams: {
            values: ['English', 'Spanish', 'French', 'Portuguese', '(other)'],
        }
        // ...other props
    }
]
</snippet>

## Customisation

### List Gap

It is possible to customise the space between the editor input and the popup when opened. Edit any cell below to see the popup displayed at an offset from the input.

<grid-example title='Select Editor List Gap' name='select-editor-list-gap' type='generated' options='{ "modules": ["clientside"] }'></grid-example>

This can be customised by setting the `valueListGap` parameter as shown below:

<snippet transform={false}>
columnDefs: [
    {
        cellEditor: 'agSelectCellEditor',
        cellEditorParams: {
            values: ['English', 'Spanish', 'French', 'Portuguese', '(other)'],
            valueListGap: 10
        }
        // ...other props
    }
]
</snippet>

### List Size

It is possible to customise the size of the list popup when opened. In the grid below, the editor popups in the right column are displayed with a specified size, whereas the editor popups in the left column are displayed with the default size.

<grid-example title='Select Editor Max Height and Max Width' name='select-editor-max-height-and-width' type='generated' options='{ "modules": ["clientside"] }'></grid-example>

This can be customised by setting the `valueListMaxHeight` and `valueListMaxWidth` parameters as shown below:

<snippet transform={false}>
columnDefs: [
    {
        cellEditor: 'agSelectCellEditor',
        cellEditorParams: {
            values: ['AliceBlue', 'AntiqueWhite', 'Aqua', /* .... many colours */ ],
            valueListMaxHeight: 120,
            valueListMaxWidth: 120
        }
        // ...other props
    }
]
</snippet>


## API Reference

<interface-documentation interfaceName='ISelectCellEditorParams' names='["values", "valueListGap", "valueListMaxHeight", "valueListMaxWidth"]'></interface-documentation>

<note>
|We have found the standard HTML Select doesn't have an API that's rich enough to play
|properly with the grid. When a cell is double clicked to start editing, it is desired that
|the Select is a) shown and b) opened ready for selection. There is no API to open a browsers
|Select. For this reason to edit there are two interactions needed 1) double click to start
|editing and 2) single click to open the Select.
|
|We also observed different results while using keyboard navigation to control editing, e.g.
|while using `Enter` to start editing. Some browsers would open the Select, others would not.
|This is down to the browser implementation and given there is no API for opening the
|Select, there is nothing the grid can do.
|
|If you are unhappy with the additional click required, we advise you don't depend on the
|browsers standard Select (ie avoid `agSelectCellEditor`) and instead use `agRichSelectCellEditor` or
|create your own using a [Cell Editor Component](../component-cell-editor/).
