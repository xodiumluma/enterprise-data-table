|When a React component is instantiated the grid will make the grid APIs, a number of utility methods as well as the cell &
|row values available to you via `props`.
|
|The editor interface is as follows:

|    // Gets called once after initialised. If you return true, the editor will not be

|    isCancelBeforeStart?(): boolean;
|
|    // Gets called once after editing is complete. If your return true, then the new

<note>
|Note that if you're using Hooks for Grid Components that have lifecycle/callbacks that the
|grid will call (for example, the `getValue` callback from an Editor Component), then you'll need to expose them with
|`forwardRef` & `useImperativeHandle`.
|
|Please refer to the [Hook](/react-hooks/) documentation (or the examples on this page) for more information.
