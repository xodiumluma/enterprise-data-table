title: "Sass Styling API"
---

The Sass Styling API is an optional lightweight wrapper around [Themes](/themes) and [Global Style Customisations](/global-style-customisation) that automates the process of importing CSS files and setting CSS variables.

The Sass API provides a few benefits on top of the CSS API:

1. **Colour blending.** The Sass API saves you the work of defining multiple related colours. For example with the Alpine theme, if you set `alpine-active-color` to `red` then the `row-hover-colour` will automatically be set to a light pink.
1. **Validation.** In the Sass API you will get a build error if you accidentally pass an invalid parameter name or value. In CSS this would be silent and lead to incorrect styling.
2. **Automatic selection of CSS files.** The Sass API ensures that only the necessary CSS files are loaded, only once, in the correct order, and combined into a single file.

## Getting started

First, set up your project to compile Sass (.scss) files. We provide examples for the major frameworks:

 - Vanilla JS and React: use the [Sass CLI](https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid-customise-theme/tree/master/src/vanilla) or [Webpack and sass-loader](https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid-customise-theme/tree/master/src/vanilla-webpack)
 - Angular: see our [Angular CLI](https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid-customise-theme/tree/master/src/angular) example
 - Vue: see our [Vue CLI](https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid-customise-theme/tree/master/src/vue) example

Next, import the Sass API in your .scss file:

```scss
@use "~ag-grid-community/styles" as ag;
```

The above import path assumes that `node_modules` is added to the Sass load path. Depending on how your project is configured, you may need to add one or more prefixes to the import path:

 - `@ag-grid-community/styles` if you're using the grid [modules](/modules/) feature
 - `node_modules/ag-grid-community/styles` if `node_modules` is not in the Sass load path
 - `~ag-grid-community/styles` is you're using webpack and sass-loader (the tilde instructs sass-loader to look in `node_modules`)

## Simple example

To emit all the styles you need for an AG Grid application, include the `grid-styles` mixin:

```scss
@use "~ag-grid-community/styles" as ag;
@include ag.grid-styles();
```

Because no theme is specified, it will default to Quartz. Compiling this file will select the `ag-grid.css` and `ag-theme-quartz.css` files from the grid distribution and combine them into the output. There is no need to separately include `ag-grid.css` in your build.

To use the theme, set the `ag-theme-quartz` class on your grid div:

```html
<div id="myGrid" class="ag-theme-quartz">
```

To customise the Alpine theme, you can add more parameters to the `grid-styles` mixin, as described in the rest of this page.

## Choosing a theme

Use the `theme` parameter to set the name of the outputted theme.

```scss
@use "~ag-grid-community/styles" as ag;
@include ag.grid-styles((
    theme: balham
));
```

This can be either:

1. a [provided theme](/themes/) (`quartz`, `quartz-dark`, `alpine`, `alpine-dark`, `balham`, `balham-dark` or `material`). The CSS file for the theme will automatically be included.
2. Any string of your choice to create a custom theme.

## Setting CSS variables

The Sass Styling API is a wrapper around the CSS variable API for design customisation, you can pass any supported CSS variable as a parameter to the Sass API:

```scss
@use "~ag-grid-community/styles" as ag;
@include ag.grid-styles((
    theme: balham,
    --ag-balham-active-color: deeppink
));
```

For information about what CSS variables and rules to use to control grid features, see the [full list of CSS variables](/global-style-customisation-variables/)

The Sass API provides a little bit of sugar to make it easier to read and remember some parameter values and assists migration from the [Legacy Sass API](/global-style-customisation-sass-legacy/).

- The `--ag-` prefix is optional.
- You can pass `true` or `false` to any `borders-*` parameter to enable or disable the border (`true` is converted to `solid 1px` and `false` to `none`)
- You can pass `true` or `false` to the `header-column-separator-display` or `header-column-resize-handle-display` parameters (`true` is converted to `block` and `false` to `none`)
- You can pass `null` to any `*-color` parameter, which will be converted to a CSS value of `transparent`

## Adding your own CSS rules

When you cannot achieve the effect you want with variables, add custom CSS rules below the `grid-styles` mixin:

```scss
@use "~ag-grid-community/styles" as ag;
@include ag.grid-styles((
    theme: alpine
));
.ag-theme-quartz {
    // Nest rules in .ag-theme-quartz so that the selectors include the theme name.
    // Without the theme name, your styles will not override the theme's built-in
    // styles due to CSS selector specificity rules.
    .ag-header-cell-label {
        font-style: italic;
    }
}
```

## Colour blending

The grid relies extensively on transparency to look good. For example when the grid is loading its data and can't be interacted with, it will display a semi-transparent overlay on top of the user interface. In order to match the grid's colour scheme we usually want this overlay to be the same hue as the grid background.

CSS cannot automatically generate a transparent version a colour, so in CSS if you change the background colour of the grid you may also want to set the `--ag-modal-overlay-background-color` variable in order to update the overlay to the new colour scheme.

The Sass Styling API will do this for you. If you define a `background-color` and have not set an explicit value for `modal-overlay-background-color` then it will be set to the background color with an opacity of 66%.

The most important parameters for colour blending are:

- The foreground color (`foreground-color`). Setting this will create a default color for many ordinary elements of the grid such as borders, header text and disabled text styles.
- The theme active color (`alpine-active-color` for Alpine or `balham-active-color` for Balham). Setting this will create defaults for visual elements that should stand out, such as selected rows, checked checkboxes, and cell range selections.

As an example of color blending in action, the following Sass file:

```scss
@use "~ag-grid-community/styles" as ag;
@include ag.grid-styles((
    theme: alpine,
    alpine-active-color: red
));
```

will compile to this CSS:

```css
/* ... content of ag-grid.css ... */
/* ... content of ag-theme-quartz.css ... */
.ag-theme-quartz {
  --ag-alpine-active-color: red;
  --ag-range-selection-border-color: red;
  --ag-selected-row-background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.1);
  --ag-row-hover-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.1);
  --ag-column-hover-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.1);
  --ag-input-focus-border-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.4);
  --ag-range-selection-background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.2);
  --ag-range-selection-background-color-2: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.36);
  --ag-range-selection-background-color-3: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.488);
  --ag-range-selection-background-color-4: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5904);
}
```

## Multiple themes

You can use multiple themes. This is useful for projects that allow the end user to select a theme. In simple use cases where each theme has the same configuration you can pass an array of theme names to the `themes` parameter.

```scss
@use "~ag-grid-community/styles" as ag;
@include ag.grid-styles((
    themes: (alpine, alpine-dark),
    alpine-active-color: red
));
```

If each theme needs a different configuration, `themes` can be a map of theme name to additional configuration:

```scss
@use "~ag-grid-community/styles" as ag;
@include ag.grid-styles((
    themes: (
        alpine: (
            header-background-color: rgb(234, 191, 177),
        ),
        alpine-dark: (
            header-background-color: rgb(72, 44, 17),
        )
        // ^^^ different header background for each theme
    ),
    alpine-active-color: red
    // ^^^ but the same active colour
));
```

## Suppressing native widget styles

Setting `suppress-native-widget-styling` to `true` will suppress native widget styling, see [Customising Inputs & Widgets](/global-style-customisation-widgets/) for more information.

## Extending a provided theme

If you want to use a provided theme (say alpine), apply some customisations, and package this as a custom theme to share between multiple apps, then you may want to use a different theme name.

To do this, set the `theme` parameter to your custom theme and the `extend-theme` parameter to one of the provided themes:

```scss
@use "~ag-grid-community/styles" as ag;
@include ag.grid-styles((
    theme: acmecorp,
    extend-theme: alpine,
    alpine-active-color: red
));
```

To use this theme, add the `ag-theme-acmecorp` class to your grid div.

Theme extension is only available in the Sass API. The alternative method of creating a [reusable package of design customisations](/global-style-customisation#creating-a-reusable-package-of-design-customisations) works in both Sass and pure CSS projects.

Theme extension works with multiple themes too, set the `extend-theme` parameter at the theme level:

```scss
@use "~ag-grid-community/styles" as ag;
@include ag.grid-styles((
    themes: (
        acmecorp: (extend-theme: alpine),
        acmecorp-dark: (extend-theme: alpine-dark),
    ),
    alpine-active-color: red
));
```

<note>
`extend-theme` internally uses the Sass `@extend` rule, which generates new selectors for `.ag-theme-acmecorp` while leaving the original selectors for `.ag-theme-quartz` intact. This slightly increases the output of the compiled CSS, but the difference is likely to be too small to measure in real world conditions (less than 1kb gzipped)
