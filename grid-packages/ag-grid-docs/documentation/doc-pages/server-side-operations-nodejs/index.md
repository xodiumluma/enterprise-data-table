Learn how to perform server-side operations using Node.js with a complete reference implementation that uses the MySQL database.


This guide is intended as a starting point when learning how to use the [Server-Side Row Model](/server-side-model/), as it provides a simple grid implementation that uses a limited set of features and grid configurations.


The sample Olympic Medals application is developed using a Node.js server that connects to a MySQL database and will demonstrate how data can be lazy-loaded as required, even when performing group, filter and sort operations when working with large datasets.

<warning>
The reference implementation covered in this guide is for demonstration purposes only. If you use
this in production it comes with no warranty or support.

The source code can be found here: [https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid-server-side-nodejs-example](https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid-server-side-nodejs-example).

## Overview

In this Olympic Medals application, the server endpoint will be hosted using a web server comprised of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) running [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), that connects to a single [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) datasource.

An overview of technologies used in this guide is illustrated in the diagram below:

We will now proceed to install and run the application before going through the implementation details.

## Download and Install

Clone the example project using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ag-grid/ag-grid-server-side-nodejs-example.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd ag-grid-server-side-nodejs-example
```

Install project dependencies and build project using:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Database Setup

Download and install the database as per the [MySQL Download](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/) documentation.


Create a database with the name `'sample_data'`. Then run the following script to create the table `olympic_winners` and populate it with data via the MySQL command line:


```bash
mysql -u root -p -D sample_data < ./data/olympic_winners.sql
```

That's it! We are now ready to run and explore the application.

## Running the application

To run the application execute the following from the command line:


```bash
yarn start
```

Then point your browser to [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/)

## Client Configuration

In order to keep this sample application as simple as possible, the grid configuration is kept to a minimum. The `gridOptions` required for our grid are shown below:


```js
// client/index.js

const gridOptions = {
    rowModelType: 'serverSide',

    columnDefs: [
        { field: 'athlete' },
        { field: 'country', rowGroup: true, hide: true },
        { field: 'sport', rowGroup: true, hide: true },
        { field: 'year', filter: 'number' },
        { field: 'gold', aggFunc: 'sum' },
        { field: 'silver', aggFunc: 'sum' },
        { field: 'bronze', aggFunc: 'sum' },
    ],
}
```

In the code snippet above, the grid is configured to use the Server-Side Row Model by setting: `gridOptions.rowModelType = 'serverSide'`.


Sorting is enabled by default. A simple number filter is also added to the 'year' column. Note that as new data is loaded the applied filters are kept.

To demonstrate [Row Grouping](/server-side-model-grouping/), the 'country' and 'sport' columns have been configured with `rowGroup = true`. Finally, to ensure the medal values are aggregated up the group hierarchy, the value columns have been set up with an aggregation function: `aggFunc='sum'`.

## Server-Side Datasource

In order to fetch data for the Server-Side Row Model we must implement the `IServerSideDatasource`, which contains a single method `getRows(params)` which accepts request params from the grid.

Successful responses are then passed back to the grid via the `params.successCallback(rows, lastRow)` as shown below:

```js
// client/index.js

const datasource = {
    getRows(params) {
        console.log(JSON.stringify(params.request, null, 1));

        fetch('./olympicWinners/', {
            method: 'post',
            body: JSON.stringify(params.request),
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json; charset=utf-8' }
        })
        .then(httpResponse => httpResponse.json())
        .then(response => {
            params.successCallback(response.rows, response.lastRow);
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.error(error);
            params.failCallback();
        })
    }
};

// register datasource with the grid
api.setGridOption('serverSideDatasource', datasource);
```

## Server Endpoint

Hosting our server endpoint `/olympicWinners` which accepts JSON requests is done with the help of the `express` and `body-parser` npm packages.


```js
// server/server.js

import webpack from 'webpack';
import webpackMiddleware from 'webpack-dev-middleware';
import webpackConfig from '../webpack.config.js';
import express from 'express';
import bodyParser from 'body-parser';

import OlympicWinnersService from './olympicWinnersService';

const app = express();
app.use(webpackMiddleware(webpack(webpackConfig)));

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false}));
app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.post('/olympicWinners', function (req, res) {
OlympicWinnersService.getData(req.body, (rows, lastRow) => {
    res.json({ rows: rows, lastRow: lastRow });
    });
});

app.listen(4000, () => {
    console.log('Started on localhost:4000');
});
```

Request are delegated to the `OlympicWinnersService` which contains all the server-side application logic. The `getData()` method queries the MySQL database using the `mysql` npm package with the SQL returned by `buildSql()`.

```js
// server/olympicWinnersService.js

import mysql from 'mysql';

class OlympicWinnersService {
    getData(request, resultsCallback) {
        const SQL = this.buildSql(request);

        connection.query(SQL, (error, results) => {
            const rowCount = this.getRowCount(request, results);
            const resultsForPage = this.cutResultsToPageSize(request, results);
            resultsCallback(resultsForPage, rowCount);
        });
    }

    buildSql(request) {
        const selectSql = this.createSelectSql(request);
        const fromSql = ' FROM sample_data.olympic_winners ';
        const whereSql = this.createWhereSql(request);
        const limitSql = this.createLimitSql(request);
        const orderBySql = this.createOrderBySql(request);
        const groupBySql = this.createGroupBySql(request);

        return selectSql + fromSql + whereSql + groupBySql + orderBySql + limitSql;
    }

    // helper methods ...
}
```

The `buildSql()` method uses a number of helper methods to build up SQL fragments used in the combined SQL which is returned. The implementation details of these helper methods are be omitted from this guide but can be examined in the project repository.

## Conclusion

In this guide we presented a reference implementation for integrating the Server-Side Row Model with a Node.js server connected to a MySQL database. This included all necessary configuration and install instructions.

A high level overview was given to illustrate the problem this approach solves before providing details of how to achieve the following server-side operations:

- Sorting
- Filtering
- Grouping
- Aggregation
