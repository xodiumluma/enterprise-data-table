|## Custom Floating Filter Interface
|
|The interface for a custom filter component is as follows:
</framework-specific-section>

<framework-specific-section frameworks="react">
<snippet transform={false} language="ts">
|interface IFloatingFilterReactComp {
|    // Gets called every time the parent filter changes. Your floating
|    // filter would typically refresh its UI to reflect the new filter
|    // state. The provided parentModel is what the parent filter returns
|    // from its getModel() method. The event is the FilterChangedEvent
|    // that the grid fires.
|    onParentModelChanged(parentModel: any, event: FilterChangedEvent): void;
|
|    // Gets called every time the popup is shown, after the GUI returned in
|    // getGui is attached to the DOM. If the filter popup is closed and re-opened, this method is
|    // called each time the filter is shown. This is useful for any logic that requires attachment
|    // before executing, such as putting focus on a particular DOM element. 
|    afterGuiAttached?(params?: IAfterGuiAttachedParams): void;

<note>
|Note that if you're using Hooks for Grid Components that have lifecycle/callbacks that the
|grid will call (for example, the `onParentModelChanged` callback from an Editor Component), then you'll need to expose them with
|`forwardRef` & `useImperativeHandle`.
|
|Please refer to the [Hooks](../react-hooks/) documentation (or the examples on this page) for more information.

|### Custom Filter Parameters
|
|When a React component is instantiated the grid will make the grid APIs, a number of utility methods as well as the cell &
|row values available to you via `props` - the interface for what is provided is documented below.
|
|If custom params are provided via the `colDef.floatingFilterComponentParams` property, these
|will be additionally added to the params object, overriding items of the same name if a name clash exists.
